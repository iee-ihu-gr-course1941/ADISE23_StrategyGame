## Documentation for `wake_vm_on_wol` System Service

### Introduction:
The `wake_vm_on_wol` system service is designed to listen for Wake-On-LAN (WOL) packets from a specific source and, upon detection, start a specified virtual machine. 

### Location:
The main script for the service is located at: `/etc/myscripts/wake_vm_on_wol.sh`
The systemd service configuration file is located at: `/etc/systemd/system/wake_vm_on_wol.service`

### Operations:

#### Start the service:
To start the `wake_vm_on_wol` service, use the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl start wake_vm_on_wol
```

#### Stop the service:
To stop the service, execute:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop wake_vm_on_wol
```

#### Restart the service:
If you made changes to the script and need to restart the service, use:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart wake_vm_on_wol
```

#### Check the service status:
To check the current status of the service (whether it's running, stopped, or has encountered any errors), use:
```bash
sudo systemctl status wake_vm_on_wol
```

#### Enable/Disable auto-start on boot:
If you want the service to start automatically when the system boots up:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wake_vm_on_wol
```
To prevent the service from starting at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable wake_vm_on_wol
```

### Log Files:

The script logs its activities to `/var/log/wol-script.log`.

#### View the logs:

You can view the logs using the `cat` command:
```bash
cat /var/log/wol-script.log
```
For real-time viewing, especially when debugging, you can use the `tail` command:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/wol-script.log
```

### Removal:

If for any reason you need to remove or delete the service:

1. **Stop the service**:

2. **Disable auto-start at boot**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable wake_vm_on_wol
   ```

3. **Delete the service configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/wake_vm_on_wol.service
   ```

4. **Reload systemd** to recognize the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

5. **Delete the main script** (if you don't need it anymore):
